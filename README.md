# How to keep your Microsoft Teams status active

Follow these steps to keep your Microsoft Teams status active using a Python script:

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Open a command prompt or terminal and type `pip install clicknium` to install the `Clicknium` library.
3. Copy the code I provided in my previous message and paste it into a text editor.
4. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example `team.py`.
5. Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type `python team.py` to run the script.

The script will start running and your mouse will move along a circle, keeping your Microsoft Teams status active. You can stop the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`.
